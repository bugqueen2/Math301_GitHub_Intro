# Conflict Practice

This file is intentionally designed to produce a merge conflict during class.

**Instructions (in class)**
1. Change the line below to reflect your favorite flavor.
2. Commit locally (do NOT push yet).
3. Pull my update from `upstream` to trigger a conflict.
4. Resolve it by producing one final combined line.
